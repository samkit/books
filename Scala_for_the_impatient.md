##Chapter 1 - The Basics
######1.6. `apply == ()` call.

##Chapter 2 - Control Structures and Functions
######2.1. Use `:paste` on REPL to paste multiline code which interpreted can analyze and run.
######2.6. The generated collection is always compatible with first generator.
```scala
for (c <- "Hello"; i <- 0 to 1) yield (c + i).toChar
    // yields "HIeflmlmop"
for (i <- 0 to 1; c <- "Hello") yield (c + i).toChar
    // yields Vector('H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'I', 'f', 'm', 'm', 'p')
```
######2.9. Use `_*` to tell the compiler that the preceding part is an argument sequence.
```scala
sum(1, 2, 3, 4)
```
is equivalent to
```scala
sum(1 to 4: _*)
```
Without this, '1 to 4' goes as a Range object.

######2.11. Lazy values,
```scala
lazy val words = scala.io.Source.fromFile("filename").mkString
```
> **Note**: Lazy variables are thread-safe and hence has a cost attached to it.

######2.12.
1. A throw expression has type "Nothing".
2. Type of if/else block when one of its branch is "Nothing", is the type of other branch.

```scala
try {
    // do something bad that throws
}
catch {
    // pattern match
    case _: SomeException => // do something
    case ex: IOException => // do something else
}
finally {
    // always called
    // Remember that variables defined inside try block is not visible here
}
```

##Chapter 3 - Working with arrays
######3.2. Mutable arrays like std::vector in C++
```scala
scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer
```
######3.5.
1. Sorting Array in place, scala.util.Sorting.quickSort(array).
2. Array to string, Array.mkString(sep).

> ArrayOps / StringOps - useful implicit classes.

######3.7. Multidimensional arrays.
```scala
Array.ofDim(3, 4) // 3 rows, 4 columns
```
######3.8. Java interoparability
```scala
import scala.collection.JavaConversions.bufferAsJavaList // to convert scala buffer to java list
```

##Chapter 4 - Maps and Tuples
######4.3. Adding/removing keys from immutables maps are not very expensive. As the maps are immutable so both new and old ones share the same underlying data.

```scala
val newMap = oldMap - "existing_key"
```

######4.5. For having keys sorted in insertion order, use `LinkedHashMap`.

##Chapter 5 - Classes
######5.2.
1. Getter and setter methods are implicitly generated by scala comiler. And looks like:

```scala
class Person {
    var age = 10
    
    def age = this.age                              // implicitly generated
    def age_=(value: Int) { /* do something */ }    // implicitly generated
}
```

2. To see compiled class, use `scala -private Person`.

```
$ scalac Person.scala
$ scala -private Person
Compiled from "Person.scala"
```
```scala
public class Person extends java.lang.Object implements scala.ScalaObject{
private int age;
public int age();
public void age_$eq(int);
public Person();
}
```

> **Note**: For `private[this]` variables, getters and setters are not generated.

######5.5. To generate `get*` or `set*` style getters and setters, use `@BeanProperty`.

```scala
class Person {
    @BeanProperty var age = 10
    
    def age                 // generated
    def age_=(value: Int)   // generated
    def getAge()            // generated
    def setAge(value: Int)  // generated
}
```

######5.6. Every auxiliary constructor must call previously defined auxiliary constructor or primary constructor.
######5.7.
1. If `val` or `var` is not specified in the primary constructor and variables are used by at least one method then the fields are object-private. If not accessed, then its not a member variable.
2. To make primary constructor private place `private` before it.

######5.8. Nested classes are distinct types even on two objects of same enclosing class.

```scala
class OuterClass {
    class InnerClass {
    }
}
val first = new OuterClass
val second = new OuterClass

// first.InnerClass and second.InnerClass are different types.
```

```scala
class Person private(var age: Int)
```

To resolve this use *type projection*, like:

```scala
class OuterClass {
    class InnerClass {
    }
    
    var objects: Array[OuterClass#InnerClass] = _       // means InnerClass of any OuterClass object
}
```
